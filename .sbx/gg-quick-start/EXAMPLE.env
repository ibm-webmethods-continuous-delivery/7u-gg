# ATTN: first clone uses HTTPS as we do not have the ssh setup yet.
# However the framework uses ssh for the rest of the operations
# You may use the HTTPS of the template, and set the real origin URL in the second variable
# Preferably, specialize the template first, then give the HTTPS and the ssh URLs after
